                            <p>I would like to rate myself an 8. 8 because I know that I am not perfect and there is
                                always a scope for learning and improvement. Continuous learning is the most fundamental
                                part of personal and professional growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Sample answer:</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>I have achieved several milestones to date in my career as a <a
                                    href="https://www.scaler.com/courses/full-stack-developer/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">software developer</a>. The most recent one is of
                                the time when we were working on a critical component of a product pertaining to
                                customer payments. We were working round the clock for around 2 months and I was a core
                                developer. I was made a lead to this component for completing the task in another 2
                                months.</p>
                            <p>To meet the deadline, we ensured that we upskilled ourselves to learn all the aspects of
                                the development of this module and also brought in a few more resources to complete it
                                faster. Post the deployment, I trained our team to support the platform proficiently.
                                Ultimately, we could complete the product well in advance of the deadline. When the
                                product was launched, the higher management was super proud of us and our team was
                                awarded for our outstanding performance in the quarterly town hall. It was a very proud
                                moment for me.</p>

                        <p>Now, this question is the trickiest and deadliest one among all. This can prove to be a
                            trap and you might not even be aware of it. While the question might seem casual, the
                            main purpose of this question is to find out how long you are planning to stay in the
                            company if hired and how your vision fits the vision of the company.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You might be tempted to answer honestly by saying things about your plans for higher
                                studies, your plans to start a startup, your plans of becoming a hiring manager in
                                the company or if you don’t have a plan then you are simply tempted to say you don’t
                                have a plan at all. These are the things the interviewer doesn’t want to hear and
                                hence avoid giving such answers.</li>
                            <li>The recruiter is only interested in knowing how long you are planning to stay in the
                                company and how satisfied you are with the current position you are going to be
                                hired.</li>

                                be a part of making a difference along with quickening my journey of becoming a Tech

                                to it and I will work on correcting myself and learn from my mistakes. This would help
                                me grow and move forward. If the feedback is negative, then I am mature enough to ignore
